## Fontys ICT for Professionals Website Redesign

This project involved redesigning the website for Fontys ICT for Professionals, a program focused on working professionals looking to upskill in the IT field. 

### Project Goals

* Improve user experience by streamlining information architecture and reducing clicks needed to find relevant content.
* Enhance accessibility to ensure the website is usable for all users across various devices and browsers.
* Introduce subtle interactive elements to cater to a target audience with an interest in nerdy easter eggs (optional).

### Tools and Technologies

* **Design:** Figma (industry-standard design tool)
* **Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactivity)

### User Research and Testing

The design process was informed by user research, including:

* Development of user personas to understand the target audience and their needs.
* User testing with Penny, who also tested the original website, to identify areas for improvement.

Key findings from user testing included:

* Information architecture required restructuring to reduce clicks needed for specific content.
* Wording in some areas lacked clarity, hindering discoverability (e.g., testimonials on the homepage).

These findings were incorporated into the redesign to enhance user experience. 

### Interactive Easter Egg (Optional)

The website incorporates an optional interactive easter egg triggered by entering the Konami code (Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A) on your keyboard. This element caters to a specific segment of the target audience who enjoys a bit of retro fun. Entering the code transforms the website into a "matrix-like" mode with green text, cascading code, and a background image change.

**Note:** The easter egg is designed to be subtle and may not be immediately noticeable to all users.

### Development Notes

The JavaScript code for the easter egg utilizes various functionalities:

* **Konami Code Detection:** It listens for key presses and checks if they match the Konami code sequence.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Upon successful code entry, the script dynamically modifies the website's Document Object Model (DOM) by changing styles (colors, fonts, background images) to create the "matrix-like" effect.
* **Canvas Animation (Optional):** An additional feature (commented out in the code) utilizes the canvas element and JavaScript to create a cascading code animation reminiscent of the Matrix movie.

**For those interested in the technical details, the full code can be found in the project repository.**

### Learnings

This project provided valuable experience in:

* Applying user research (personas) to inform design decisions.
* Utilizing an iterative design process to address user feedback and improve the website.
* Implementing interactive elements using JavaScript to enhance user experience for a specific audience segment.
* Balancing easter egg visibility with maintaining a clean and accessible user experience.

**We welcome your feedback and contributions to this project!**
